# This is a Chat app made with React and the API https://chatengine.io 

Inside this project you have a Landing Page with LogIn controlled form, style imported from Vanta.

##Once logged, you will find a single page chat interface where you can:

-Send messages to your contacts
-Create new chat groups
-Add new participants
-Send pictures
-Visualize read receipts
-Send with Enter key and more! 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser. (If you want to LogIn, this feature is yet to be finished as you will need to be registered as:

# User: Zane 
# Password: 123456789

The LogOut feature is yet not implemented but it could easily be made adding a button that deletes the LocalStorage and redirects the user to the Landing Page.

## THANKS FOR YOUR TIME!
